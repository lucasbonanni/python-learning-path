# Description

It is time to learn to see the result (or the lack thereof) of the game. In this stage, you should analyze a Tic-Tac-Toe field.

Is it already clear who's the winner or is the game not over yet? Is it a draw or an impossible combination of moves? Let's find out!

Note that in this stage either 'X' or 'O' can start the game.
Objectives

In this stage your program should:

    Fill the field from the input and print it as in the previous stage.
    Find the state in which the game is at the moment and print it. Possible states:

    "Game not finished" when no side has a three in a row but there are still empty cells;
    "Draw" when no side has a three in a row and there are no empty cells left;
    "X wins" when the field has three Xs in a row;
    "O wins" when the field has three Os in a row;
    "Impossible" when the field has three Xs in a row as well as three Os in a row. Or the field has a lot more Xs that Os or vice versa (if the difference is 2 or more, should be 1 or 0). For this stage, consider that the game can start both with X or O.

Also, you can use ' ' or '_' to print empty cells â€“ it's up to you.
Examples

The examples below show outputs for some predefined states. Your program should work in the same way.
The greater-than symbol followed by space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
